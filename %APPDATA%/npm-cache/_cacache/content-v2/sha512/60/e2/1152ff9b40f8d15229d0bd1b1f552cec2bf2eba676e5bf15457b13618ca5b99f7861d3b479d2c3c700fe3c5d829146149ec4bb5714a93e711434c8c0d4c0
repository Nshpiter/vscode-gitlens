It also enables your app to get tokens to access [Microsoft Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/enterprise) services such as [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io).\n\n### OAuth2.0 grant types supported:\n\nThe current version supports the following ways of acquiring tokens:\n\n#### Public Client:\n\n-   [Authorization Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) with [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/)\n-   [Device Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/device-code/)\n-   [Refresh Token Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/)\n-   [Silent Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-acquire-cache-tokens#acquiring-tokens-silently-from-the-cache)\n-   [Username and Password flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows#usernamepassword)\n\n#### Confidential Client:\n\n-   [Authorization Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) with a client credential\n-   [Refresh Token Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/)\n-   [Silent Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-acquire-cache-tokens#acquiring-tokens-silently-from-the-cache)\n-   [Client Credential Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/)\n-   [On-behalf-of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow)\n-   [Username and Password flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows#usernamepassword)\n\nNote that the username and password flow is deprecated and support will be removed in a future release.\n\nMore details on different grant types supported by Microsoft authentication libraries in general can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows). \n\n### Scenarios supported:\n\nThe scenarios supported with this library are:\n\n-   Desktop app that calls web APIs\n-   Web app that calls web APIs\n-   Web APIs that call web APIs\n-   Daemon apps\n\nMore details on scenarios and the authentication flows that map to each of them can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-flows-app-scenarios).\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/faq.md).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore using `@azure/msal-node` you will need to register your app in the azure portal:\n\n-   [App registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/auth-register-app-v2)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Via NPM:\n\n```javascript\nnpm install @azure/msal-node\n```\n\n## Node Version Support\n\nMSAL Node will follow the [Long Term Support (LTS) schedule of the Node.js project](https://nodejs.org/about/releases/). Our support plan is as follows.\n\nAny major MSAL Node release:\n\n-   Will support stable (even-numbered) Maintenance LTS, Active LTS, and Current versions of Node\n-   Will drop support for any previously supported Node versions that have reached end of life\n-   Will not support prerelease/preview/pending versions until they are stable\n\n| MSAL Node version | MSAL support status | Supported Node versions |\n| ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |\n| 4.x.x             | Active development  | 20, 22, 24              |\n| 3.x.x             | Active development  | 16, 18, 20, 22, 24      |\n| 2.x.x             | In maintenance      | 16, 18, 20, 22          |\n| 1.x.x             | In maintenance      | 10, 12, 14, 16, 18      |\n\n**Note:** There have been no functional changes in the MSAL Node v2 release.\n\n## Usage\n\n### MSAL basics\n\n-   [Understand difference in between Public Client and Confidential Clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-client-applications)\n-   [Initialize a Public Client Application](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/initialize-public-client-application.md)\n-   [Initialize a Confidential Client Application](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/initialize-confidential-client-application.md)\n-   [Configuration](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/configuration.md)\n-   [Request](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-common/docs/request.md)\n-   [Response](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-common/docs/Response.md)\n\n## Samples\n\nThere are multiple [samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples) included in the repository that use MSAL Node to acquire tokens. These samples are currently used for manual testing, and are not meant to be a reference of best practices, therefore use judgement and do not blindly copy this code to any production applications.\n\nAAD samples:\n\n-   [auth-code](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/auth-code): Express app using OAuth2.0 authorization code flow.\n-   [auth-code-pkce](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/auth-code-pkce): Express app using OAuth2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE.\n-   [device-code](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/device-code): Command line app using OAuth 2.0 device code flow.\n-   [refresh-token](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/refresh-token): Command line app using OAuth 2.0 refresh flow.\n-   [silent-flow](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/silent-flow): Express app using OAuth2.0 authorization code flow to acquire a token and store in the token cache, and silent flow to use tokens in the token cache.\n-   [client-credentials](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/client-credentials): Daemon app using OAuth 2.0 client credential grant to acquire a token.\n-   [on-behalf-of](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/on-behalf-of): Web application using OAuth 2.0 auth code flow to acquire a token for a web API.

Your project will be rebuilt upon changes. TSDX has a special logger for you convenience. Error messages are pretty printed and formatted for compatibility VS Code's Problems tab. The library will be rebuilt if you make edits.\n\n#### `npm run build`\n\nBundles the package to the `dist` folder.\nThe package is optimized and bundled with Rollup into multiple formats (CommonJS, UMD, and ES Module).\n\n#### `npm run build:all`\n\nBuilds both `msal-common` and `msal-node`\n\n#### `npm run lint`\n\nRuns eslint with Prettier\n\n#### `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:watch`\n\nRuns the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.\nBy default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.\nGenerate code coverage by adding the flag --coverage. No additional setup needed. Jest can collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files.\n\n## Security Reporting\n\nIf you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible.
