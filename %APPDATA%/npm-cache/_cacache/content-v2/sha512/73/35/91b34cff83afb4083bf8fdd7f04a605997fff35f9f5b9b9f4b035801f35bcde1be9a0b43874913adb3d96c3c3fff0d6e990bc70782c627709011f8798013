It also enables your app to get tokens to access [Microsoft Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/enterprise) services such as [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io).\n\nThe `@azure/msal-common` package described by the code in this folder serves as a common package dependency for the `@azure/msal-browser` package (and in the future, the msal-node package). Be aware that this is an internal library, and is subject to frequent change. **It is not meant for production consumption by itself.**\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-common/FAQ.md).\n\n## Prerequisites and Usage\n\nThis library is not meant for production use. Please use one of these packages specific to the platform you are developing for:\n\n-   [MSAL for Single Page Applications (SPAs)](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-browser)\n-   [MSAL for Node.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-node)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Via NPM:\n\n    npm install @azure/msal-common\n\n## Security Reporting\n\nIf you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. Your submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will contact you shortly upon receiving the information.
