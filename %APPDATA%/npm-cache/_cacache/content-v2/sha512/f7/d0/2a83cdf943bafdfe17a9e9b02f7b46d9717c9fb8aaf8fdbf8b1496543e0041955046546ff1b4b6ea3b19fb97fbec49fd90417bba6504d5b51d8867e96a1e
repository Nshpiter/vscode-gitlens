Setting the `VSCE_STORE=file` environment variable will revert back to the file credential store. Using the `VSCE_PAT` environment variable will also avoid using keytar.\n\nDepending on your distribution, you will need to run the following command:\n\n- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`\n- Alpine: `apk add libsecret`\n- Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`\n- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall vsce globally:\n\n```console\nnpm install --global vsce\n```\n\nVerify the installation:\n\n```console\nvsce --version\n```\n\n`vsce` is meant to be mainly used as a command line tool. It can also be used a library since it exposes a small [API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce/blob/main/src/api.ts). When using vsce as a library be sure to sanitize any user input used in API calls, as a security measurement.\n\n## Usage via Docker\n\nYou can also build a container for running vsce:\n\n```console\n$ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --tag vsce \"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce.git#main\"\n```\n\nValidate the container:\n\n```console\ndocker run --rm -it vsce --version\n```\n\nPublish your local extension:\n\n```console\ndocker run --rm -it -v \"$(pwd)\":/workspace vsce publish\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can configure the behavior of `vsce` by using CLI flags (run `vsce --help` to list them all). Example:\n\n```console\nvsce publish --baseImagesUrl https://my.custom/base/images/url\n```\n\nOr you can also set them in the `package.json`, so that you avoid having to retype the common options again. Example:\n\n```jsonc\n// package.json\n{\n  \"vsce\": {\n    \"baseImagesUrl\": \"https://my.custom/base/images/url\"\n    \"dependencies\": true,\n    \"yarn\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Development\n\nFirst clone this repository, then:\n\n```console\n$ npm install\n\n$ npm run watch:build # or `watch:test` to also build tests\n```\n\nOnce the watcher is up and running, you can run out of sources with:\n\n```console\nnode vsce\n```\n\nThis project uses [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) and commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec. This allows us to effortlessly automate releases.\n\n## About\n\nThis tool assists in packaging and publishing Visual Studio Code extensions.\n\nRead the
