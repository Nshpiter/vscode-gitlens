As a \"core\" library, it shouldn't need to be added as a dependency to any user code, only other Azure SDK libraries.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall this library using npm as follows\n\n```\nnpm install @azure/core-auth\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\nThe `TokenCredential` interface represents a credential capable of providing an authentication token. The `@azure/identity` package contains various credentials that implement the `TokenCredential` interface.\n\nThe `AzureKeyCredential` is a static key-based credential that supports key rotation via the `update` method. Use this when a single secret value is needed for authentication, e.g. when using a shared access key.\n\nThe `AzureNamedKeyCredential` is a static name/key-based credential that supports name and key rotation via the `update` method. Use this when both a secret value and a label are needed, e.g. when using a shared access key and shared access key name.\n\nThe `AzureSASCredential` is a static signature-based credential that supports updating the signature value via the `update` method. Use this when using a shared access signature.\n\n## Examples\n\n### AzureKeyCredential\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleAzureKeyCredential\nimport { AzureKeyCredential } from \"@azure/core-auth\";\n\nconst credential = new AzureKeyCredential(\"secret value\");\n\nconsole.log(credential.key); // prints: \"secret value\"\n\ncredential.update(\"other secret value\");\n\nconsole.log(credential.key); // prints: \"other secret value\"\n```\n\n### AzureNamedKeyCredential\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleAzureNamedCredential\nimport { AzureNamedKeyCredential } from \"@azure/core-auth\";\n\nconst credential = new AzureNamedKeyCredential(\"ManagedPolicy\", \"secret value\");\n\nconsole.log(`${credential.name}, ${credential.key}`); // prints: \"ManagedPolicy, secret value\"\n\ncredential.update(\"OtherManagedPolicy\", \"other secret value\");\n\nconsole.log(`${credential.name}, ${credential.key}`); // prints: \"OtherManagedPolicy, other secret value\"\n```\n\n### AzureSASCredential\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleSASCredential\nimport { AzureSASCredential } from \"@azure/core-auth\";\n\nconst credential = new AzureSASCredential(\"signature1\");\n\nconsole.log(credential.signature); // prints: \"signature1\"\n\ncredential.update(\"signature2\");\n\nconsole.log(credential.signature); // prints: \"signature2\"\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou can build and run the tests locally by executing `npm run test`. Explore the `test` folder to see advanced usage and behavior of the public classes.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you run into issues while using this library, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/new).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to this library, please read the [contributing
