Client libraries should only be aware of and interact with a `TracingClient` instance.\n  - A `TracingClient` implementation can be created using the `createTracingClient` factory function.\n- `Instrumenter` provides an abstraction over an instrumentation and acts as the interop point for using third party libraries like OpenTelemetry. By default, a no-op `Instrumenter` is used. Customers who wish to enable `OpenTelemetry` based tracing will do so by installing and registering the [@azure/opentelemetry-instrumentation-azure-sdk] package.\n- `TracingContext` is an **immutable** data container, used to pass operation-specific information around (such as span parenting information).\n- `TracingSpan` is an abstraction of a `Span` which can be used to record events, attributes, and exceptions.\n\n## Examples\n\nExamples can be found in the `samples` folder.\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou can build and run the tests locally by executing `npm run test`. Explore the `test` folder to see advanced usage and behavior of the public classes.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you run into issues while using this library, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/new).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to this library, please read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more about how to build and test the code.\n\n[@azure/opentelemetry-instrumentation-azure-sdk]:
