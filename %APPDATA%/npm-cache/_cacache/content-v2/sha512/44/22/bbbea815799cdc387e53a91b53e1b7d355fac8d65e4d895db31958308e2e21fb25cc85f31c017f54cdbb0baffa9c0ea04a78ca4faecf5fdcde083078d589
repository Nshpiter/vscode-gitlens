Instead they\nuse `AbortController` and `AbortSignal` provided by their platforms and pass the abort signals to Azure SDK operations.\n\nKey links:\n\n- [Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/core/abort-controller)\n- [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/abort-controller)\n- [API Reference Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/azure/abort-controller-readme)\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall this library using npm as follows\n\n```\nnpm install @azure/abort-controller\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\nUse `AbortController` to create an `AbortSignal` which can then be passed to Azure SDK operations to cancel\npending work. The `AbortSignal` can be accessed via the `signal` property on an instantiated `AbortController`.\nAn `AbortSignal` can also be returned directly from a static method, e.g. `AbortSignal.timeout(100)`.\nthat is cancelled after 100 milliseconds.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe below examples assume that `doAsyncWork` is a function that takes a bag of properties, one of which is\nof the abort signal.\n\n### Example 1 - basic usage\n\n```js\nconst controller = new AbortController();\ndoAsyncWork({ abortSignal: controller.signal });\n\n// at some point later\ncontroller.abort();\n```\n\n### Example 2 - Aborting with timeout\n\n```js\nconst signal = AbortSignal.timeout(1000);\ndoAsyncWork({ abortSignal: signal });\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou can build and run the tests locally by executing `rushx test`. Explore the `test` folder to see advanced usage and behavior of the public classes.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you run into issues while using this library, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/new).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to this library, please read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more about how to build and test the
