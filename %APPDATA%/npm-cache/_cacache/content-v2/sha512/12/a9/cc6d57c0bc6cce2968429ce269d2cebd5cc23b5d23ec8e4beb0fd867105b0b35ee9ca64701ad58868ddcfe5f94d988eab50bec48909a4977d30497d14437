It also enables your app to get tokens to access [Microsoft Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/enterprise) services such as [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io).\n\nThe `@azure/msal-browser` package described by the code in this folder uses the [`@azure/msal-common` package](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-common) as a dependency to enable authentication in JavaScript Single-Page Applications without backend servers. This version of the library uses the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE. To read more about this protocol, as well as the differences between implicit flow and authorization code flow, see the section [below](#implicit-flow-vs-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce).\n\nThe `@azure/msal-browser` package **does NOT** support the implicit flow.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/FAQ.md).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n-   `@azure/msal-browser` is meant to be used in [Single-Page Application scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-overview).\n\n-   Before using `@azure/msal-browser` you will need to [register a Single Page Application in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-app-registration) to get a valid `clientId` for configuration, and to register the routes that your app will accept redirect traffic on.\n\n## Installation\n\n### CDN Deprecation\n\n> :warning: The `@azure/msal-browser` CDN has been fully deprecated as of `@azure/msal-browser@3.0.0` and is no longer supported. App developers using the MSAL CDN must upgrade to the latest possible version and consume MSAL through a package manager or bundling tool of their choice. For more information on version support, consult the table in the project [README.md](../../README.md#library-version-support-status).\n\n### Via NPM\n\n```javascript\nnpm install @azure/msal-browser\n```\n\n### Via Yarn\n\n```javascript\nyarn add @azure/msal-browser\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Migrating from Previous MSAL Versions\n\nSelect the guide that matches your current MSAL version:\n\n-   [Migrating from MSAL v4.x to MSAL v5.x](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/v4-migration.md)\n-   [Migrating from MSAL v3.x to MSAL v4.x](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/v3-migration.md)\n-   [Migrating from MSAL v2.x to MSAL v3.x](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/v2-migration.md)\n-   [Migrating from MSAL v1.x to MSAL v2.x](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/v1-migration.md)\n\n### MSAL Basics\n\n1. [Initialization](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/initialization.md)\n2. [Logging in a User](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/login-user.md)\n3.

Key benefits include:\n\n- **Enhanced Security**: PKCE provides protection against authorization code interception attacks\n- **No Tokens in URLs**: Tokens are never exposed in the browser's URL or history\n- **Refresh Token Support**: Enables long-lived sessions through refresh tokens\n- **OIDC Compliance**: Fully compliant with OpenID Connect standards\n\n## Framework Wrappers\n\nIf you are using a framework such as Angular or React you may be interested in using one of our wrapper libraries:\n\n-   Angular: [@azure/msal-angular](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular)\n-   React: [@azure/msal-react](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-react)\n\n## Security Reporting\n\nIf you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. Your submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will contact you shortly upon receiving the information.
