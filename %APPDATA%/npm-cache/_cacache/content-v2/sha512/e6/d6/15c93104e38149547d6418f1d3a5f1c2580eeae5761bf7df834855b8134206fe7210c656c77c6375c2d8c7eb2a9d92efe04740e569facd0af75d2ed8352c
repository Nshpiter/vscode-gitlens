It provides the methods `sendOperationRequest` and `sendRequest`.\n\n`sendRequest` simply makes an HTTP request using a `Pipeline` (see `@azure/core-rest-pipeline` for details.)\n\n`sendOperationRequest` is used by generated code to make a request using an `OperationSpec` and `OperationArguments`. An `OperationSpec` is a translation of request requirements from the OpenAPI/Swagger file that describes the service.\n\n### createClientPipeline\n\nThis method is used to create a `Pipeline` instance that is customized with extra policies that perform serialization and deserialization. The bulk of the work is in converting requests into the right HTTP message that a service expects and then converting the HTTP response payload into the response shape described by the service's OpenAPI specification file.\n\n### Mappers / createSerializer\n\n`Mapper`s are used to encode and decode data into HTTP headers and bodies. They describe all request and response fields. They are referenced by `OperationSpec`s.\n\nThe method `createSerializer` creates a `Serializer` that is used to do the bulk of the work transforming data when making a request or processing a response. Given a corpus of `Mapper`s and the appropriate `OperationSpec` it can manufacture an HTTP request object from a user provided input or convert an HTTP response object into a user-friendly form.\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou can build and run the tests locally by executing `npm run test`. Explore the [test](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/core/core-client/test) folder to see advanced usage and behavior of the public classes.\n\nLearn more about [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) and the [autorest.typescript extension](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.typescript) for generating a compatible client on top of this package.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you run into issues while using this library, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/new).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to
